\description{
The Chirp model consists of two non-linear parameters: Œ± (non zero unknown
frequency present in the model) and Œ≤ (unknown chirp rate present in the model)
and two linear parameters A and B which are the amplitudes. Now this function takes the input data and generates grid for the non-linear parameters over the interval (0,pi) X (0,pi). The Approximate Least Squares approach is being used, in this approach, the periodogram function is maximized iteratively to update the estimates of Œ± andùõΩ.The process continues until a convergence criterion is satisfied, yielding the Approximate Least Squares estimates.
}
\usage{
chirp_est(x)
}
%- For using this function we need to give the data or a vector of time series observations, the function will return the estimates of the four parameters of the Chirp model and also the estimate of the standard error.
\arguments{
  \item{y_t}{A vector of time series observations}.

\value{\item{est}{est is a vector which returns the initial choices of Œ±,Œ≤, the
     approximate least square estimates of Œ±, Œ≤, A, B and also the estimate of
     the standard error.}
     \item{res}{res is the residuals obtained by fitting the model.}
